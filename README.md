Description of custom sorting algorithm
My custom sorting algorithm uses my already written insertion sort algorithms
for small arrays and merge sort for large arrays. For mid-size arrays on the
otherhand I use quicksort with two pivots.

Notes on using Copilot (or other AI)
I used ChatGPT to help me figure out what an efficient sorting algorithm would
be and it also told me which sorting algorithms would be the most efficient
depending on the size of the array. It also helped me figure out the case
that was causing problems where if lowerbound value is less than the
upperbound value you need to swap the pivots.
